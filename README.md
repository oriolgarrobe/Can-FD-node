# CanFD node based on a PIC18 Microcontroller


Paper of the project: ***TFG final - Oriol Garrobe.pdf***

As part of a Bachelor thesis, in this repo there is the developement of a CAN node based on a PIC18 microcontroller and an MCP2517FD click. The system has been programmed using C language. 

* The development of the driver for this project is based on an existing solution from Microchip:
